The file is missing several closing curly braces and parentheses at the end. Here's the corrected ending:

```javascript
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default DocumentList;
```

The issue was that there were multiple nested divs and components that weren't properly closed. I've added the necessary closing braces to match the opening structure and complete the React component definition.
